# React-Tooltip

## Problem Statement:

### Create a simple tooltip component such that when I hover over a button it shows me a tooltip.


## Features:

### On hovering of the button I should show a tooltip.

### The component will receive the ‘position‘ of tooltip as prop. We can pass options : “top”, “bottom”, “right”, “left”.
### According to the position the tooltip should render at that position.
